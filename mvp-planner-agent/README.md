# MVP Mobile App Planner Agent

A **single-responsibility planning agent** that helps you refine a **mobile app MVP idea** into a
clear, technical, builder-ready specification.

This agent:

- **Asks focused clarifying questions** about users, use cases, constraints, and success metrics.
- **Generates a structured MVP + technical requirements spec** using modern mobile app practices.
- **Outputs one thing only** at the end: a **complete, self-contained prompt string** that you can
  pass directly to a separate *builder agent* (e.g., another script or external LLM).

The planner is available in two modes:
- **Web UI** (recommended): Interactive chat-based interface built with Streamlit
- **CLI**: Command-line interface for terminal-based workflows

Built with `langchain-openai` and the OpenAI API.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- OpenAI API key (`OPENAI_API_KEY`)
- `uv` package manager (recommended) or `pip`

## Install

From the `mvp-mobile-agent` directory:

```bash
uv sync
```

Or with `pip`:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in this directory with:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
```

- `OPENAI_MODEL` is optional; defaults to `gpt-4o-mini` if not set.

## Run

### Web UI (Recommended)

Launch the interactive web interface:

```bash
uv run streamlit run ui.py
```

Or if you're using pip/venv:

```bash
streamlit run ui.py
```

This will open your browser to `http://localhost:8501` with a chat-based interface where you can:
- Enter your app idea
- View and answer clarifying questions
- Review the generated requirements spec
- Get the final builder prompt with download option

The UI provides:
- 📱 **Chat-style interface** for natural conversation flow
- 📊 **Progress tracking** in the sidebar
- 💬 **Conversation history** to review previous steps
- 📥 **Download button** for the builder prompt
- 🔄 **Easy navigation** between steps

### CLI Mode

Run the command-line interface:

```bash
uv run python main.py
```

Or if you're using pip/venv:

```bash
python main.py
```

You will be guided through:

1. A short Q&A about your **mobile app idea** (who it’s for, what it does, constraints).
2. A set of **clarifying questions** generated by the planner.
   - You can answer directly in the terminal, **or** type `@answers.txt` to load answers from a
     text/markdown file you edit in your IDE.
3. A **requirements + technical spec** preview.
4. A final step that prints a **single “builder prompt” string**.

You can copy that final prompt and feed it directly into your own *MVP builder* agent.

## High-Level Flow

1. **Idea intake**
   - You type a high-level description of your app.
2. **Clarification**
   - The planner asks targeted questions (users, use cases, platforms, budget/timeline, tech prefs,
     KPIs, competitors).
   - You answer in one block of text.
3. **Requirements synthesis**
   - The agent turns your idea + answers into a structured MVP and technical spec:
     - Problem, users, value prop
     - Key user journeys
     - MVP features vs non-goals
     - Platforms and stack hints
     - Constraints and success metrics
4. **Builder prompt generation**
   - Using that spec, the planner generates a **single, well-structured prompt** for a builder agent.
   - The prompt bakes in:
     - Modern mobile app stack knowledge (React Native, SwiftUI, Kotlin/Compose, backend options,
       CI/CD, testing)
     - Clear role/instructions for the builder
     - The full spec as context
   - The program prints **only this final prompt** at the end, ready to be copy‑pasted.

## Project Structure

```text
mvp-mobile-agent/
├── main.py         # Single-purpose planner CLI that outputs a builder prompt
├── ui.py           # Streamlit web UI for interactive planning
├── pyproject.toml  # Dependencies
├── README.md       # This file
└── .env            # OpenAI config (gitignored)
```

## Notes

- This agent is intentionally **single-purpose**: it plans and generates a builder prompt; it does
  **not** generate code.
- You can use the final prompt with:
  - Another Python agent,
  - A notebook,
  - Or directly in your LLM IDE / chat client as the system or user message.
- To extend the system, you would typically:
  - Keep this planner as-is,
  - Add a separate `mvp-builder-agent/` that consumes the planner’s prompt and focuses purely on
    architecture and implementation planning or codegen.
