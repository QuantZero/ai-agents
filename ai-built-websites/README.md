AI-Built Websites

A curated collection of websites generated with AI and deployed live.

This repository functions as a build log, showcase, and experimentation space for AI-assisted web development. Each project explores how modern AI tools can be used to rapidly design, generate, refine, and ship production-ready websites.

⸻

Purpose
	•	Experiment with AI-driven website generation
	•	Showcase live, hosted AI-built websites
	•	Compare prompts, tools, and workflows
	•	Iterate quickly from concept to deployment
	•	Document what works and what doesn’t

⸻

What You’ll Find
	•	AI-generated website projects
	•	Clean, production-ready frontend code
	•	Prompt strategies used during generation
	•	Iterative refinements and design variations
	•	Live deployment links when available

⸻

Tech Stack (Varies by Project)

Depending on the website, projects may include:
	•	HTML, CSS, JavaScript
	•	React or Next.js
	•	Tailwind CSS
	•	Vercel or Netlify hosting
	•	AI tools such as LLMs, website builders, and design agents

Each project includes its own notes or sub-README when relevant.

How These Sites Are Built
	1.	Define goals, audience, and constraints
	2.	Generate layouts, copy, and components with AI
	3.	Refine structure, UX, and performance manually
	4.	Clean and harden the codebase
	5.	Deploy and iterate

AI accelerates execution, but final quality is always human-reviewed.

Live Demos

Live URLs are included inside each project folder when available.

Disclaimer

These projects are created with AI assistance and may include experimental patterns. Always review, test, and secure the code before using it in production or client-facing environments.

⸻

Roadmap
	•	Add reusable prompt libraries and templates
	•	Benchmark different AI tools and workflows
	•	Improve per-project documentation
	•	Add performance and accessibility audits
	•	Expand into full SaaS and landing-page systems
